=head1 NAME

CGI::Bus::upws - User Personal WorkSpace


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CGI::Bus;
 $s =CGI::Bus->new();
 $s->upws->evaluate;

=head1 DESCRIPTION


This module is a user personal work space.
There are two subsystems: workspace and 'u'sers 's'ites.
Users sites facility is not very scalable, 
it is for a small sites with a few publishers of the pages.

Uses L<CGI::Bus::uauth|CGI/Bus/uauth>, L<CGI::Bus::udata|CGI/Bus/udata>.
See L<CGI::Bus::Base|CGI/Bus/Base> for inherited slots and methods.


=head1 SLOTS

Common HTTP and HTML settings should be in L<CGI::Bus|CGI/Bus> parent object.

=over

=item -index

URL of the Index HTML page or reference to URLs list (see C<-urls>), optional


=item -indexes

Reference to URLs list like C<-index>, to place on the navigation pane
below C<-index> and above C<-usurl> and C<-urlst>


=item -logo

HTML logo or URL of logo image to place at the top of the navigation pane,
just before the name of the user.
Default is '/icons/portal.gif' on Apache
and 'web.gif' on IIS.


=item -search

Search system URL or sub{}; optional


=item -searchms

Search hook 
sub(self, Query object, Util object, [pathSearch,...], [[pathBegin, pathReplace],...]){} 
to be called before Microsoft Index Server Query object 'CreateRecordset'
method called.
Required when using Microsoft Index Server.
Attention: Results of Microsoft Index Server calls are impersonated
and dependent on filesystem ACLs and effective user account.

If both C<-search> and C<-searchms> defined, 
C<-search> should contain URL of search script and
C<-searchms> will be used to produce search.
This behaviour is useful with impersonated search script like

 $ENV{QUERY_STRING}='_run=SEARCH'
                   .($ENV{QUERY_STRING} ? '&' .$ENV{QUERY_STRING} : '');
 chdir('..');
 do('upws.cgi'); # impersonated when called



=item -urls

URLs array ref or sub{} to place at the end of the 
navigation pane.
Each URL should be HTML or 'label|URL' string.
URLs lists may be assigned for users and groups of
users individually. This parameter is the most common list.


=item -urlst

Like C<-urls>, but to place above user's URLs and C<-urls>.


=item -usfirst

Sub{} to determine users sites to be sorted first and 
to be placed above others
See below C<-uspath>, C<-usudir>, C<-uspdir>, C<-uspfile>, C<-usurl>, C<scrusites>


=item -uspath

Users sites base path, directory with users publish HTML pages.
Default is calculated when only C<-usurl> is defined.
See below C<-usudir>, C<-uspdir>, C<-uspfile>, C<-usurl>, C<scrusites>


=item -uspdir

Users sites publish dirs inside C<-usudir>, 
subdirectories of user's directory where should be pages to publish.
Default ['pub',''].
See also C<-uspath>, C<scrusites>


=item -uspfile

Users sites publish files inside C<-uspdir>,
filenames to be published as main pages.
Default 
['index.url','index.html','index.htm','default.url','default.html','default.htm'].
See also C<-uspath>, C<scrusites>


=item -uspurf

Users sites publish filesystem URL,
used to open user's directory for the current user
for publishing.
Default C<-uspurl>


=item -uspurl

Users sites publish URL,
used to open user's directory for the current user
for publishing.
Default C<-usurl>


=item -usudir

Users sites users dirs,
subdirectories with the deepest publish dirs and files.
Above this subdirectories may be group subdirectories
with publish files.
Default ['users','home',''].
See also C<-uspath>, C<scrusites>


=item -usurl

Users sites base URL.
Adds reference to users pages if defined.
See also C<-uspath>, C<scrusites>

=head1 METHODS

The most commonly used is C<evaluate>.


=over


=item evaluate () -> requested HTML screen

Dispatcher of the 'scr...' calls below.
See source code for commands used.


=item scrtop () -> top HTML screen

Generates top HTML page, which is a frameset of
left (navigation) pane and right (content) pane.


=item scrleft () -> navigation pane HTML screen

Generates navigation pane HTML page, the left part of the screen.


=item scrright () -> content pane HTML screen

Generates content pane HTML page, the right part of the screen.


=item scrsetup () -> user settings HTML screen

Generates user settings HTML page, interacts with used when editing and saving.
See source code for setup fields names and descriptions.


=item scrusites () -> users sites HTML screen

Users sites map HTML page, based on
C<-uspath> and C<-usurl>.
Data collected within C<-uspath> directory structure 
are cached inside temporary directory.

=head1 VERSION

=over

=head2 20/10/2002

=item New:

C<-search>, C<-searchms> slots. 
Problem: Microsoft Index Server calls should be impersonalisated
to obtain rightly ACL checked results.


=head2 12/09/2002

=item Changed:

C<scrleft> discards duplicate rows to display.
'label|URL|_target|URL' syntax added to deal with a complex pages.
Logotype (C<-logo>) enclosed within URL filling the current browser window 
with C<scrleft>.



=head2 21/08/2002

=item New:

'USITES' CGI param for C<scrusites> identifier or number
- to use multiple sets of users home pages, empty parameter
means default page set




=head2 28/02/2002

=item New:
